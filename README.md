# exercism_solutions
My solutions to some of the exercises on multiple Exercism.io language tracks

Only the solutions are written by me, the tests and everything else is provided by Exercism.

I usually try to solve the exercises without looking at solutions from others, but after I get the tests passing,
sometimes I look at the community solutions to check for alternatives or better implementations.
Sometimes I update my solution with parts and/or ideas from others, which is a pretty good way to learn specific
language features and/or different algorithm strategies.
